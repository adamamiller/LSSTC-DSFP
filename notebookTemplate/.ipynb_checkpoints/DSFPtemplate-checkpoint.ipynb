    "We have found that modular notebooks work best. Thus the typical construction includes $\\sim3-5$ capital P Problems, each with sub-problems a, b, c, d, etc. The Problems address major ideas from the lecture, while the sub-problems directly address the nitty gritty details related to implementation of the idea. Most sub-problems require some measure of coding (*typically $\\lesssim 10$ lines in a single sub-problem is best*), though some simply ask for responses regarding the data or the code that has just been written. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modular structure allows the students to move at their own pace, and at this point they all understand that problems get progressively more difficult throughout the notebook. Within the time that is allotted, some students finish and others do not. Following the Problems, there is always a **Challenge Problem** for the students that finish early. These Challenge Problems are always more difficult and typically are not as well structured as the earlier Problems in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An essential tip** - in my experience it is by *far* best to start by writing the solutions to the notebook. This ensures that all the code works and behaves as expected [it also helps control the total time necessary to complete the problems]. Then the notebook for the students can be created by copying the solutions and removing important portions of the code using `# complete` as you will see in the examples below."
