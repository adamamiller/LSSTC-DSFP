    "This image of the Ring nebular and the nearby spiral is really nice. The background is black. The stars are not saturated (in the sense that it is extremely easy to tell the difference between the red stars and blue stars). Structure in the ring nebular can be seen (though the outermost halo is missing, see e.g., **3c**). And the nearby barred-spiral looks especially good. The nucleus is somewhat orange, suggesting an older stellar population, while the arms are clearly blue (and therefore forming stars at a higher rate than the nucleus).\n",
