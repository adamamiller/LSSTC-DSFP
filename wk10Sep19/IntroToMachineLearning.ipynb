    "Broadly speaking, machine-learning methods constitute a diverse collection of data-driven algorithms designed to classify/characterize/analyze sources in multi-dimensional spaces. The topics and studies that fall under the umbrella of machine learning is growing, and there is no good catch-all definition. The number (and variation) of algorithms is vast, and beyond the scope of these exercises. While we will discuss a few specific algorithms today, more importantly, we will explore the scope of the two general methods: unsupervised learning and supervised learning and introduce the powerful (and dangerous?) Python package [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\n",

    "Generally speaking, the procedure for `scikit-learn` is uniform across all machine-learning algorithms. Models are accessed via the various modules (`ensemble`, `SVM`, `neighbors`, etc), with user-defined tuning parameters. The features (or data) for the models are stored in a 2D array, `X`, with rows representing individual sources and columns representing the corresponding feature values. [In a minority of cases, `X`, represents a similarity or distance matrix where each entry represents the distance to every other source in the data set.] In cases where there is a known classification or scalar value (typically supervised methods), this information is stored in a 1D array `y`. \n",

    "Supervised machine learning, on the other hand, aims to predict a target class or produce a regression result based on the location of labelled sources (i.e. the training set) in the multidimensional feature space. The \"supervised\" comes from the fact that we are specifying the allowed outputs from the model. As there are labels available for the training set, it is possible to estimate the accuracy of the model (though there are generally important caveats about generalization, which we will explore in further detail later).\n",

    "\n",
    "We will begin with a simple, but nevertheless, elegant algorithm for classification and regression: [$k$-nearest-neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) ($k$NN). In brief, the classification or regression output is determined by examining the $k$ nearest neighbors in the training set, where $k$ is a user defined number. Typically, though not always, distances between sources are Euclidean, and the final classification is assigned to whichever class has a plurality within the $k$ nearest neighbors (in the case of regression, the average of the $k$ neighbors is the output from the model). We will experiment with the steps necessary to optimize $k$, and other tuning parameters, in the detailed break-out problem.\n",

    "In `scikit-learn` the [`KNeighborsClassifer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) algorithm is implemented as part of the [`sklearn.neighbors`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.neighbors) module. \n",

The main reason for this is some viginica flowers lie far outside the main virginica locus, and within predominantly versicolor \"neighborhoods\". In addition to knowing the accuracy for the individual classes, it is also useful to know class predictions for the misclassified sources, or in other words where there is \"confusion\" for the classifier. The best way to summarize this information is with a confusion matrix. In a confusion matrix, one axis shows the true class and the other shows the predicted class. For a perfect classifier all of the power will be along the diagonal, while confusion is represented by off-diagonal signal. \n",
