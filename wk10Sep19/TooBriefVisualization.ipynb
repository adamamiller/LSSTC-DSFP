    "Starting with 2MASS and SDSS and extending through LSST, we are firmly in an era where data and large statistical samples are cheap. With this explosion in data volume comes a problem: we do not know the underlying probability density function (PDF) of the random variables measured via our observations. Hence - density estimation: an attempt to recover the unknown PDF from observations. In some cases theory can guide us to a parametric form for the PDF, but more often than not such guidance is not available. "
